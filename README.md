# Implementation-of-Artificial-Neural-Networks-ANN-and-K-NN
• Implemented ANN model using Tensorflow and Keras to classify the customers who are likely to get a bank subscription

• Experimented with a number of layers, number of nodes, activation functions, and evaluated the model performance.

• Applied K-Nearest Neighbor model to the same data to classify data points based on Euclidean, Mahalanobis distance, and experimented with number of neighbors.
